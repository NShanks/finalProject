what do i have right now?

json of the # of teams, # of players per team, # of games, # of low games to drop, boolean warzone or not


what do i want it to be?
json with objects
example: i dont want the # of teams. i want a team variable? with the # of teams as empty objects

rn
teams = 30
what i want
teams = [
	{team1: ['', '', '']}
	{team2: ['', '', '']}
	...
	{team30: ['', '', '']}
] 

teams = [
	['', '', '']
	['', '', '']
	...
	['', '', '']
]

teams = {
	team1: ['', '', ''],
	team2: ['', '', ''],
	...
	team30: ['', '', '']
} for loop team + incrementing number set to empty list `${i}` based on the team number


but the players need to be editable and also be able to match up with the warzone json

warzone json looks like this
data['allPlayers']['player']['username']
data is an object
allPlayers is a LIST of unnamed? objects
player is an object within the unnamed? object
playerStats an the object before the player object
